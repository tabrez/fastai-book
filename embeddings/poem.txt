In a world where the dinosaurs roam,
There's a place that they call home.
With trees so high and skies so blue,
There's always something fun to do.

T-Rex, Triceratops, big and small,
Some can fly, some can crawl.
They play all day in the sun,
In the land where fun's never done.

So close your eyes and you will see,
A world full of mystery.
With dinosaurs, big and small,
In dreams, you can meet them all!

Brachiosaurus, tall and grand,
Stomping all across the land.
Velociraptor, quick and sly,
Underneath the moonlit sky.

Pterodactyl in the air,
Soaring without any care.
Stegosaurus, spiky tail,
In a world where they prevail.

Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Triassic,
Their existence was fantastic.
In our dreams, they're still alive,
In our hearts, they'll always thrive.

From A to Z, they're all so cool,
Learning about them in school.
Three times over, we've said their names,
In this poem of dinosaur games!

Roaming in what's now called Rex.

Hunting in packs by day and night.

Its prey's defenses it would pierce.

Living among the dike's.
Xenotarsosaurus once roamed Argentina's land,
Now its fossils lay in sand.

Yangchuanosaurus was a fearsome beast,
On other dinosaurs, it feasted.
Zephyrosaurus was small and light,
Hiding in plain sight under moonlight.

Now we've journeyed from A to Z through time so vast,
These creatures from our distant past.
Though they're gone, in our dreams they soar and run,
In our hearts, their story's never done!

In a world where the ocean's creatures play,
There's a new adventure every single day.
With waves so high and water so blue,
There's always something exciting to view.

Sharks and dolphins, big and small,
Some can leap, some can crawl.
They swim all day under the sun,
In the sea where fun's never done.

Gliding gracefully and free.

Underneath the starlit sky.

Soaring without any bother.

In a world where they've had enough.

Their existence is key.
In our dreams, they're still alive,
In our hearts, they'll always thrive.

Among coral reefs they go.

These creatures from our present and past
Though some are threatened, in our dreams they swim and run
In our hearts, their story's never done!
