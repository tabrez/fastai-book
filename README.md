# Deep Learning for Coders with fastai & PyTorch by Jeremy Howard & Sylvain Gugger

## Summary

Personal repository to practice code from the fastai book.
Code is in Jupyter Notebooks. Checkpoints folder is being committed but no
data is added to the repository. Code insidee the notebook should download
the datasets automatically.

I need to change the base directory manually based on where the code is being run:
+ JupyterHub docker container
+ Google Colab
+ Kaggle

To run the notebooks using docker container, refer to the Dockerfile that's in a separate
repository[add link here later].
